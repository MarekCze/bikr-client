## Current Focus: Phase 1 Completion - User Profile & Onboarding (Completed)

We have completed the implementation of the Phase 1 User Profile and Onboarding features as outlined in `bikr-client/memory-bank/features/phase1-completion-profile-onboarding.md`.

**Summary of Work Done:**
- Implemented all required methods in `SupabaseProfileRepository`, including `deleteBike`, and updated method signatures (`updateBike`). Added corresponding unit tests.
- Added `interests` and `experienceLevel` fields to the shared `User` type.
- Implemented the full onboarding flow (`welcome`, `interests`, `experience`, `bike-setup`, `permissions`) using Tamagui components, including data saving and permission requests.
- Refactored all profile management screens (`index`, `edit`, `garage`, `add-bike`, `edit-bike`, `settings`) using Tamagui components, integrating repository methods and adding basic loading/error handling.
- Resolved various TypeScript and configuration issues encountered during implementation (e.g., missing packages, incorrect paths, component prop usage).

**Status:**
The core functionality for Phase 1 Profile & Onboarding is complete and integrated. The UI has been refactored using Tamagui.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with the next phase outlined in the development plan (likely Phase 3: Social Interaction Features, starting with the Comment System).
- Address any remaining minor TODOs or potential refinements noted in the code (e.g., advanced validation, specific UI tweaks, `uploadAvatar` file conversion).
- Review and test the completed features thoroughly.
