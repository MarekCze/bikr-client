## Current Focus: Phase 1 Completion - User Profile & Onboarding

We have been working on implementing the remaining parts of Phase 1 for the client application, specifically focusing on the User Profile and Onboarding features outlined in `bikr-client/memory-bank/features/phase1-completion-profile-onboarding.md`.

**Progress:**
- Created and implemented the core `SupabaseProfileRepository` with methods for getting/updating profiles, uploading avatars, getting the garage, adding bikes, and updating bikes. Basic unit tests were added.
- Set up the directory structure and placeholder screens for the multi-step onboarding flow (`app/onboarding/`).
- Set up the directory structure and placeholder screens for the profile management section (`app/profile/`).
- Implemented basic data fetching and display logic for the main profile screen (`app/profile/index.tsx`).
- Implemented basic form handling and update logic for the edit profile screen (`app/profile/edit.tsx`).
- Integrated `expo-image-picker` for avatar selection and connected it to the repository's `uploadAvatar` method.
- Implemented basic data fetching for the garage screen (`app/profile/garage.tsx`).
- Implemented basic form handling and save logic for the add bike screen (`app/profile/add-bike.tsx`).
- Implemented basic form handling, placeholder fetching, and update logic for the edit bike screen (`app/profile/edit-bike/[id].tsx`).
- Created a basic settings screen structure (`app/profile/settings.tsx`).

**Next Steps When Resuming:**
1.  **Implement `deleteBike`:** Add the `deleteBike` method to `SupabaseProfileRepository.ts` and its corresponding unit tests. Integrate this into the `handleDelete` function in `app/profile/edit-bike/[id].tsx`, including a confirmation dialog.
2.  **Refine UI Components:** Replace placeholder React Native components (TextInput, Button, Switch) with appropriate Tamagui components throughout the onboarding and profile screens for consistent styling and theme support.
3.  **Implement `getBikeById` (or alternative):** Decide on the strategy for fetching data in `edit-bike/[id].tsx` (either add `getBikeById` to the repo or filter the full garage list) and implement it.
4.  **Complete Onboarding Logic:** Implement the actual UI for interest/experience selection, bike form details, and permission requests in the respective onboarding screens. Integrate fully with the `ProfileRepository` to save data. Define the final navigation target after onboarding completes.
5.  **Complete Profile Logic:** Flesh out the profile view, edit form, garage list items, and settings options. Ensure robust error handling and loading states. Fully integrate all actions with the repository.
6.  **Address TODOs:** Work through remaining TODO comments in the created files (e.g., validation, file conversion for uploads, specific backend assumptions).
