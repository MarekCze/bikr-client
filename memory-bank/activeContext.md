## Current Focus: Phase 3.2 - Following & Connections (Initial Implementation Complete)

**Summary of Work Done (Phase 3.2):**
- Defined shared types for pagination (`PaginatedUsersResponse` in `bikr-shared`).
- Created `ISocialRepository` interface and `SupabaseSocialRepository` implementation (`bikr-client/repositories/`).
- Created reusable `UserListItem` component (`bikr-client/components/profile/`).
- Created `useDebounce` hook (`bikr-client/hooks/`).
- Implemented user search functionality within the Explore tab (`bikr-client/app/(tabs)/explore.tsx`).
- Created dedicated screens for Followers and Following lists (`bikr-client/app/profile/followers.tsx`, `bikr-client/app/profile/following.tsx`).
- Updated the main Profile screen (`bikr-client/app/profile/index.tsx`) to display follower/following counts and link to the new list screens.

**Status:**
The initial client-side implementation for Phase 3.2 Following & Connections is complete. Core components, repositories, and screens are in place.

**Next Steps:**
- Refine Phase 3.2 implementation:
    - Address TODOs noted in the code (fetching initial follow status for lists/search, implementing pagination/infinite scroll).
    - Resolve the minor TypeScript error related to `useDebounce` import in `explore.tsx`.
    - Enhance error handling.
- Proceed with Phase 3.3: Content Sharing (Client-Side).
- Review and test the implemented Phase 3.2 features thoroughly.
