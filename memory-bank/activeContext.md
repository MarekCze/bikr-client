## Current Focus: Paused - Awaiting Phase 4 Server API & Shared Package Update

**Summary of Recent Work (Shared & Server Prep for Phase 4):**
- Defined shared types (`Club`, `ClubMembership`, `PaginatedResponse`, etc.) and validation schemas (`CreateClubSchema`, etc.) in `@bikr/shared`.
- Defined `IClubRepository` interface in `@bikr/shared`.
- Generated Supabase types for the server project.
- Created initial `SupabaseClubRepository` structure on the server.

**Previous Client Work (Phase 3.2):**
- Defined shared types for pagination (`PaginatedUsersResponse` in `bikr-shared`).
- Created `ISocialRepository` interface and `SupabaseSocialRepository` implementation (`bikr-client/repositories/`).
- Created reusable `UserListItem` component (`bikr-client/components/profile/`).
- Created `useDebounce` hook (`bikr-client/hooks/`).
- Implemented user search functionality within the Explore tab (`bikr-client/app/(tabs)/explore.tsx`).
- Created dedicated screens for Followers and Following lists (`bikr-client/app/profile/followers.tsx`, `bikr-client/app/profile/following.tsx`).
- Updated the main Profile screen (`bikr-client/app/profile/index.tsx`) to display follower/following counts and link to the new list screens.

**Status:**
- Phase 3.2 (Following/Connections) initial client implementation is complete.
- Phase 4 shared definitions are complete in the `@bikr/shared` source.
- Phase 4 client implementation is **blocked** pending completion of the server API and the publishing/updating of the `@bikr/shared` package.

**Next Steps (Client):**
- Refine Phase 3.2 implementation:
    - Address TODOs noted in the code (fetching initial follow status for lists/search, implementing pagination/infinite scroll).
    - Resolve the minor TypeScript error related to `useDebounce` import in `explore.tsx`.
    - Enhance error handling for Phase 3.2.
- Proceed with Phase 3.3: Content Sharing (Client-Side).
- Review and test the implemented Phase 3.2 features thoroughly.
- **Once Server API for Phase 4 is ready and `@bikr/shared` is updated:**
    - Update `@bikr/shared` dependency in `bikr-client`.
    - Begin implementing Phase 4 client features (Repository, Components, Screens) as outlined in `features/phase4-club-management.md`.
