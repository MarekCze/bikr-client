## Current Focus: Phase 5.2 - Event Management Implementation

**Summary of Recent Work (Phase 5 Event Management):**
- Implemented comprehensive client-side event management features:
  - Created event type definitions in `@bikr/shared`
  - Implemented `IEventRepository` interface and `SupabaseEventRepository`
  - Developed `EventContext` for state management
  - Built complete event UI component system:
    - `EventListItem` and `EventList` for event discovery
    - `EventHeader` for displaying event titles, dates, and metadata
    - `EventDetailsSection` for showing comprehensive event information
    - `ParticipateButton` for handling event participation status
  - Created full event management screens:
    - Event discovery page (`app/event/index.tsx`)
    - Event creation form (`app/event/create.tsx`)
    - Event details screen with component integration (`app/event/[eventId]/index.tsx`)
    - Event settings/edit screen with delete functionality (`app/event/[eventId]/settings.tsx`)
    - Event navigation layout (`app/event/_layout.tsx`)

**Server-Side Implementation (Now Complete):**
- Completed all server-side Event Management endpoints:
  - Core event CRUD operations
  - Participant management endpoints
  - Event feed functionality
  - Route planning features
- Implemented full business logic in EventService
- Fixed authentication handling across all routes
- Registered endpoints in main routes file

**Status:**
- Server-side Phase 5 implementation is complete (pending tests/docs)
- Client-side Phase 5.2 is approximately 75% complete:
  - Core event discovery, creation, viewing, and editing functionality is implemented
  - Main event components (Header, Details, ParticipateButton) are complete
  - Event settings screen with edit/delete capabilities is complete
  - Remaining work: participant management, schedule handling, route/location features
- Phase 4 (Club Management) is complete on both server and client

**Next Steps (Client):**
- Complete Phase 5.2 Event Management:
  - Implement event participants listing screen
  - Create participant list component
  - Develop event scheduling components
  - Integrate map/location features for event planning
  - Connect remaining client UI to server endpoints
- Refine Phase 3.2 implementation:
  - Address TODOs (fetching initial follow status, pagination)
  - Resolve TypeScript errors
- Proceed with Phase 3.3: Content Sharing (Client-Side)
