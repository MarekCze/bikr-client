## Current Focus: Phase 5 - Event Management Implementation (100% Complete)

**Summary of Recent Work (Phase 5 Event Management):**
- Implemented comprehensive client-side event management features:
  - Created event type definitions in `@bikr/shared`
  - Implemented `IEventRepository` interface and `SupabaseEventRepository`
  - Developed `EventContext` for state management
  - Built complete event UI component system:
    - `EventListItem` and `EventList` for event discovery
    - `EventHeader` for displaying event titles, dates, and metadata
    - `EventDetailsSection` for showing comprehensive event information
    - `ParticipateButton` for handling event participation status
    - `EventParticipantListItem` for displaying event participants with status
    - `EventSettingsForm` for creating and editing event details
    - `EventScheduleItem` for displaying event schedule items
  - Created full event management screens:
    - Event discovery page (`app/event/index.tsx`)
    - Event creation form (`app/event/create.tsx`)
    - Event details screen with component integration (`app/event/[eventId]/index.tsx`)
    - Event settings/edit screen with delete functionality (`app/event/[eventId]/settings.tsx`)
    - Tabbed event navigation layout (`app/event/[eventId]/_layout.tsx`)
    - Event participants listing screen (`app/event/[eventId]/participants.tsx`)
    - Event schedule screen (`app/event/[eventId]/schedule.tsx`)

**Server-Side Implementation (Now Complete):**
- Completed all server-side Event Management endpoints:
  - Core event CRUD operations
  - Participant management endpoints
  - Event feed functionality
  - Route planning features
- Implemented full business logic in EventService
- Fixed authentication handling across all routes
- Registered endpoints in main routes file

**Status:**
- Server-side Phase 5 implementation is complete (pending tests/docs)
- Client-side Phase 5 is now 100% complete:
  - Core event discovery, creation, viewing, and editing functionality is implemented
  - All main event components are complete (Header, Details, ParticipateButton, ParticipantList, ScheduleItem)
  - All screens are implemented (index, create, [eventId]/index, [eventId]/settings, [eventId]/participants, [eventId]/schedule)
  - Tabbed navigation within event pages is working properly
  - Event component system has been fully integrated
  - Route/location planning features (Phase 5.3) have been implemented with all major components
- Phase 4 (Club Management) is complete on both server and client

**Next Steps (Client):**
- Integrate Routes with Events:
  - Connect route selection to group ride event creation
  - Add route preview in event details for ride events
  - Enable route sharing between event participants
- Refine Phase 3.2 implementation:
  - Address TODOs (fetching initial follow status, pagination)
  - Resolve TypeScript errors
- Proceed with Phase 3.3: Content Sharing (Client-Side)
