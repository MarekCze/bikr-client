## Technical Considerations (Client-Side)
### Offline Functionality

Queue user actions (posts, comments) locally for upload when connection is restored.
Implement offline map caching/storage for saved routes.
Manage data synchronization logic upon reconnection.

### Performance Optimization

Implement lazy loading for media content in lists and galleries.
Optimize image/video display and potentially handle client-side compression before upload.
Implement efficient data pagination in UI lists (e.g., FlashList).
Optimize client-side code for battery usage, especially during ride tracking (GPS usage).

### Privacy Controls (Client UI)

Implement UI for granular location sharing settings.
Implement UI for content visibility options (e.g., public, followers only).
Implement UI for managing profile information visibility.
Implement UI toggle to hide garage contents from public view.

### Monetization Potential (Client UI)

Implement UI variations for premium subscription features.
Display promoted listings/events/clubs based on data from the backend.
Integrate SDKs for in-app advertising if required.
Handle UI flows related to marketplace commissions if necessary (e.g., displaying fees).
