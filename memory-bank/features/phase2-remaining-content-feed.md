# Feature: Phase 2 Remaining - Content & Feed System

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete Phase 2: Content & Feed System.

## Status Summary (Updated 2025-04-18)
- **Phase 2.1 (Content Domain):** Mostly complete. Repositories implemented. Creation UI implemented. State management status unknown. Shared validation pending.
- **Phase 2.2 (MediaCard Component System):** Largely complete. Core components implemented.
- **Phase 2.3 (Feed System):** Mostly complete. Repositories implemented and integrated into `FeedContext`. UI components and caching utility exist. Filtered feed UI integration pending.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Implement Client-Side Repositories [COMPLETED]
   - **Goal:** Abstract data fetching logic for content and feeds.
   - **Tasks:**
     - [x] Define `IContentRepository` interface. (`bikr-client/repositories/IContentRepository.ts`)
     - [x] Implement `SupabaseContentRepository` interacting with backend content endpoints (CRUD operations, media uploads). (`bikr-client/repositories/SupabaseContentRepository.ts`)
     - [x] Define `IFeedRepository` interface. (`bikr-client/repositories/IFeedRepository.ts`)
     - [x] Implement `SupabaseFeedRepository` interacting with backend feed endpoints (fetching different feed types, handling pagination). (`bikr-client/repositories/SupabaseFeedRepository.ts`)

### 2. Implement Content Creation Flow [PARTIALLY COMPLETE]
   - **Goal:** Allow users to create posts (text, image, video).
   - **Tasks:**
     - [x] Create UI screen/component for post composition. (`bikr-client/app/(tabs)/create.tsx`)
     - [x] Implement text input handling.
     - [x] Implement image/video selection/upload integration (using `expo-image-picker` and `SupabaseContentRepository`).
     - [x] Connect UI to Content Repository `createPost` method.
     - [ ] Integrate shared validation rules (`bikr-shared`). (Blocked by missing package)
     - [ ] Refine User ID handling (currently placeholder/direct hook usage).
     - [ ] Implement navigation/success feedback after posting.

### 3. Integrate Feed System Components [PARTIALLY COMPLETE]
   - **Goal:** Connect Feed UI, Repositories, and Caching.
   - **Tasks:**
     - [x] Integrate `SupabaseFeedRepository` into `FeedContext`. (`bikr-client/contexts/FeedContext.tsx`)
     - [x] Implement data fetching logic using the repository within `FeedContext`.
     - [x] Integrate `feedCache` for caching feed results within `FeedContext`.
     - [x] Implement infinite scroll logic (fetching next page via repository using `nextCursor`) within `FeedContext`.
     - [x] Implement pull-to-refresh logic (clearing cache for the feed type and refetching) within `FeedContext`.
     - [ ] Verify/Implement UI integration for filtered feeds (e.g., passing filters from UI to `loadFilteredFeed`).
     - [ ] Refine repository instantiation in `FeedContext` (consider DI/context).

### 4. Implement/Verify Content State Management [PENDING]
   - **Goal:** Manage content-related state effectively (especially for optimistic updates, local state).
   - **Tasks:**
     - Choose/confirm state management library (Zustand/Redux Toolkit).
     - Define state slices/stores for content and feed data.
     - Implement actions/reducers for fetching, creating, updating content.
     - Implement optimistic updates for actions like posting or liking.
     - Connect state management to UI components.
