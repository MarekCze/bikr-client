# Comment System

## Overview
The Comment System provides a comprehensive solution for viewing, creating, and managing comments on posts within the bikR app. It enables users to engage with content through comments, replies, likes, and more.

## Development Plan Reference
This feature corresponds to the Social Interaction pillar of the development plan, specifically the commenting functionality that allows users to engage with posts and interact with other users.

## Status
Complete

## Architecture

The comment system follows a modular component architecture:

```
Comment System
├── CommentInput - Form for creating new comments
├── CommentItem - Individual comment display with reply functionality
├── CommentList - List of comments with pagination
├── Comments - Main component that combines functionality and UI
```

### Component Relationships

- **Comments** is the main entry point that provides a button to show comment count and open the comment interface
- **CommentList** manages fetching and displaying top-level comments
- **CommentItem** displays each comment and manages its replies
- **CommentInput** provides the form for creating new comments or replies

### Data Flow

1. User clicks on the comment button
2. Comments component opens a modal sheet
3. CommentList fetches comments for the post
4. CommentItems display each comment with like/reply functionality
5. CommentInput allows adding new comments
6. API calls update the backend when comments are created, edited, or deleted

## API Integration

The comment system integrates with the content API through the following endpoints:

- `getCommentsByPostId` - Fetch comments for a post
- `createComment` - Create a new comment
- `updateComment` - Edit an existing comment
- `deleteComment` - Remove a comment
- `likeComment` / `unlikeComment` - Toggle like status on a comment

## Features

- Create top-level comments on posts
- Reply to existing comments (nested comments)
- Like/unlike comments
- Edit your own comments
- Delete your own comments
- Pagination for large comment threads
- Real-time comment count updates
- Visual indicators for liked comments

## User Experience

- Comments are displayed in a modal sheet to avoid cluttering the main feed
- Nested replies are visually distinguished to show conversation threads
- Comment count is displayed next to the comment button
- Timestamps show when comments were created
- User avatars and names make it clear who posted each comment

## Integration Points

- Integrated with the EngagementRibbon through CommentButton
- Uses the shared API client for data operations
- Leverages the same styling system as the rest of the app

## Technical Implementation Details

- Complete TypeScript typing for all components and data
- Optimistic updates for better user experience (e.g., comment count updates immediately)
- Error handling for failed API operations
- Uses React hooks for state management
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
